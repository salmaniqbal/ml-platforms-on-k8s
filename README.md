# ml-platforms-on-k8s

We have two examples of installing ML frameworks on kubernetes using helm charts. Spark and Ray, I am making sure we have a full end to end code working from training to serving. Currently, using helm charts the operators & CRDS can be installed on the cluster and deploy and simple job. We can start with either, maybe go with Ray first.
